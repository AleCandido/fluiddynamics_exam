    motivations: |
      one possible dust disc mass, small enough to make back reaction on the
      gas negligible
    position: |
      to-gas ratio is initially assumed constant for the whole disc
  ndusttypesinp:

    motivations: |
      number of 'small' grain sizes set to two at initializations tiems; this
      number should be 11 for the paper, but here I simplify for shorter and
      less intensive runtime

      specify first of three values, most extreme choice for largeness (also in
      the paper, see Fig. 2)

  dustbinfrac1:
    value: 0.4
    motivations: |
      mainly interested in the first two dusts, dedicate most of the total - in
      any case they should not interact with each other, due to the limited
      feedback on the gas, so it should be only a matter of resolution

      essentially little to not constraint: "the gap width alone cannot
      uniquely constrain the planet mass because changes in the grain density
      (i.e. the Stokes number) can produce the same gap width with a
      different planet mass"
