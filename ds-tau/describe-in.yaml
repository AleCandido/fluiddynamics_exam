        change inherited from patching setup (it changed the default value) -
        it is a very mild change in any case, less than 1% on the snapshot
        frequency
  nmax:
    value: -1
    motivation: |
      run time specified in simulation time (`tmax`), no constraint on steps ->
      ignore this
    position: null
  nout:
    value: -1
    motivation: |
      dump frequency specified in simulation time (`dtmax`), no constraint on
      steps -> ignore this
    position: null
  nmaxdumps:
    value: -1
    motivation: |
      do not constraint on maximum dumps, do as many as required
    position: null
  twallmax:
    value: 000:00
    motivation: |
      do not constraint simulation length in wall time, intermediate snapshot
      can be used in any case
    position: null
  dtwallmax:
    value: 000:00
    motivation: |
      do not constraint dump frequency in wall time, manually monitor if it is
      taking too much
  nfulldump:
    value: 10
    motivation: |
      default reasonable frequency
    position: null
  iverbose:
    value: 0
    motivation: |
      default, sensible for production runs (higher values used for debug, not
      lower because I'm not as confident to completely give up on diagnostics)

        change inherited from patching setup: while before I set to the value
        given in the paper, here I left the value generated, in principle
        from $\alpha_{SS}$, also quoted in the paper
        there is no agreement between the two settings, so it has to have been
        generated from something else too, that has been set differently from
        the original paper setup

        wrongly interpreted value, the motivation is th one for setting
        'accrplanet1' in setup, so the good one would have ben keeping the

  # options for injecting/removing particles
  rkill:

    motivation: |
      kill particles that are too far, since they are no longer relevant and
      slow down the simulation
